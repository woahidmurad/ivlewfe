# ivlewfe: Lewbel (2012) 2SLS IV estimation with cross-section, time-series, pooled and (multiple levels of) fixed effects and clustered standard errors

**ivlewfe** is a Stata command that implements the heteroskedasticity-based instrumental variable (IV) estimator proposed by [Lewbel (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.102.3.1263). It extends Lewbelâ€™s method by allowing for:

- High-dimensional fixed effects via `ivreghdfe`
- Cluster-robust or heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors
- Optional external instruments
- Reproducible internal IV names
- Optional saving or automatic removal of internal IVs
- Full support for factor variables (e.g., `i.year`, `c.age#c.age`)
- First-stage diagnostics and small-sample adjustments

This makes **ivlewfe** well-suited for applied researchers working with panel data or models with multiple fixed effects and endogenous regressors.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

To install the command directly from GitHub, type the following in your Stata command window:

```stata
net install ivlewfe, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/woahidmurad/ivlewfe/main/") replace
```

---

## ðŸ“˜ Usage

The syntax follows a standard 2SLS pattern:

```stata
ivlewfe depvar exogvars (endogvar = external_IVs), fe(fixed_effects) ///
    [cluster(clustvar)] [robust] [saveinst(stub)] ///
    [first] [small]
```

To use only internal Lewbel instruments (no external IVs):

```stata
ivlewfe depvar exogvars (endogvar = ), fe(fixed_effects)
```

---

## ðŸ’¡ Examples

Simple Lewbel IV with one fixed effect:

```stata
webuse nlswork
ivlewfe ln_w age tenure (tenure = ), fe(idcode)
```

With external instruments and small-sample adjustment:

```stata
ivlewfe ln_w age tenure (tenure = union south), fe(idcode year) ///
    cluster(idcode) small first saveinst(myiv)
```

Excluding a variable from IV generation:

```stata
ivlewfe ln_w age tenure (tenure = ), fe(idcode) skipiv(age)
```
